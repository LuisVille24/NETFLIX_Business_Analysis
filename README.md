# NETFLIX Data Exploration and Visualization (POWER BI)

## Business Statement
- The aim of this case study is to determine which type of shows/movies to produce and how to grow the business for Netflix in different countries by analysing the dataset provided.

- It can be observed that from 2019 afterwards the number of TV Shows and Movies added to Netflix have dropped drastically.
- Perhaps, this is part of a new business strategy to focus more on quality than quantity (e.g binge-worthy content). This could also be a result of recent financial struggles - this would require further investigation.

## Content Ratings
